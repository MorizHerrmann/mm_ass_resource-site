Micrometeorology - Assignment - Wind Resource and Site Assessment

This ReadMe leads you through the tasks and solution ways of the assignment.


Resource Assessment:
1. <data_clean.py>          Data of sprogo is cleaned.
2. <data_sectionalize.py>   Cleaned data is sectionalized.
3. <calc_akf.py>            Find Weibull parameters and frequency of occurrence.
4. <calc_ape2.py>           Calculate the AEP at Sprogo and extrapolate to Nyborg and Korsor.

5. <k_variation.py>         Show the variation if k is decreased by 10%.

6. <maxmin_years.py>        Find and save the year with the least and most wind.
7. <calc_aep2.py>           Calculate the AEP at Sprogo and extrapolate to Nyborg and Korsor.


Site Assessment:
1. <weibull_parameter_method.py:  Calculate extreme wind with Weibull parameter method. 
2. <maxwind.m>: Calculate extreme wind with Gumbel Fitting's method and Probability weighted moments. Extrapolate extreme wind to Nyborg and Korsor
